SimpleDistributedSum.java - Detailed Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Import MPI Package:
   - import mpi.*;
   - This imports the MPJ Express library which provides the classes and methods needed for MPI operations.

2. Main Function:
   - public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
   - This is where the program execution begins.

3. Initialize MPI:
   - MPI.Init(args);
   - It initializes the MPI environment, preparing all the processes for communication.

4. Identify Process Rank and Total Size:
   - int rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Rank();
   - int size = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Size();
   - rank: The unique ID for each process (starting from 0).
   - size: The total number of processes running.

5. Define Unit Size and Buffers:
   - int unitSize = 5;
   - int[] sendBuffer = new int[unitSize * size];
   - int[] recvBuffer = new int[unitSize];
   - unitSize: Number of elements each process will handle.
   - sendBuffer: Complete array created by the root process (process 0).
   - recvBuffer: Sub-array each process receives after scattering.

6. Root Process Initializes Data:
   - Only if (rank == 0):
   - Fill sendBuffer with numbers 1, 2, ..., unitSize*size.

7. Scatter Operation:
   - MPI.COMM_WORLD.Scatter(sendBuffer, 0, unitSize, MPI.INT,
                             recvBuffer, 0, unitSize, MPI.INT, 0);
   - sendBuffer is divided into chunks of unitSize and sent to each process.
   - Every process, including root, gets its portion in recvBuffer.

8. Each Process Computes Local Sum:
   - int localSum = 0;
   - for loop: Sum up the values inside recvBuffer.

9. Each Process Prints Local Sum:
   - System.out.println("Process " + rank + " local sum: " + localSum);
   - Every process prints its computed sum.

10. Reduce Operation:
    - int[] finalSum = new int[1];
    - MPI.COMM_WORLD.Reduce(new int[]{localSum}, 0, finalSum, 0, 1, MPI.INT, MPI.SUM, 0);
    - All localSums from each process are gathered and summed up at the root process (rank 0).

11. Root Process Displays Final Sum:
    - if (rank == 0):
    - System.out.println("Final sum: " + finalSum[0]);
    - Only the root process prints the total sum.

12. Finalize MPI:
    - MPI.Finalize();
    - Properly shuts down the MPI environment.

Expected Working Example:
- If size = 4 and unitSize = 5
- Total elements = 20 (1 to 20)
- Processes receive:
  - Process 0: 1,2,3,4,5 → sum = 15
  - Process 1: 6,7,8,9,10 → sum = 40
  - Process 2: 11,12,13,14,15 → sum = 65
  - Process 3: 16,17,18,19,20 → sum = 90
- Final sum = 15+40+65+90 = 210

Summary:
- The program demonstrates how to divide work among processes (Scatter), compute partial results, and aggregate them (Reduce) using MPI in Java.
